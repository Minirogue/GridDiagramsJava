# Grid Diagrams

Java (and Kotlin) code for working with Grid Diagrams developed during my PhD work. It includes classes for Wang-Landau weight training and sampling as well as a canonical-like Markov chain.

##  Installing

This package builds with Gradle using a wrapper.

### Linux and Mac OS

To compile the code, open a terminal in the top-level directory and run `./gradlew build` (untested on Mac OS).

To compile the documentation (Javadocs+Kdocs) run `./gradlew dokka`. The documentation will be found in the docs folder.

### Windows

Open the top-level directory and run `gradlew.bat` (untested)
